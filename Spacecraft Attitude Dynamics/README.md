This project, assigned as part of the Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics course during the first year of my Master's program in Space Engineering, focused on designing and analyzing the attitude determination and control system of a spacecraft.

The goal was to develop a control strategy and model the sensors and actuators to execute an initial detumbling, a slew maneuver, and maintain pointing stability.

We used the MATLABÂ® Simulink environment to model the system and simulate its operation.
