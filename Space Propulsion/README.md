This project presents the work completed for the Space Propulsion course during the first year of my Master's program in Space Engineering.

The project involved the design of a cryogenic blowdown bipropellant engine. This project covered the entire design process, from conceptualization to detailed analysis. Key elements of the project included thermodynamic cycle analysis, selection and design of engine components, and performance optimization. The design and simulations were carried out using the MATLAB environment and CEA software
